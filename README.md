It contains 3 Python/Jupyter Notebook files:
1. def_statistics_CS.py - this file calculates the deforestation statistics used in the Chi-square analysis.
2. LR_statistics_CS.py - this file calculates the LR (legal forest reserve) statistics used in the Chi-square analysis.
3. duplicate_filter.ipynb - this file is used to identify suspected duplicates in the CAR database.

It contains 3 R Markdown files:
1. CAR21_PoissonOverlap.Rmd - this is the main analysis file which fits the Poisson generalized linear mixed-effects models.
      * the dataset can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/en02cup52fjp9og47uv46/CAR21_GLMMs_dataset_oct_FINAL.csv?rlkey=1sowd8uwdpykzarh6dio2yyju&dl=0.  The dataset is large and the glmm models take some time to fit.
      * Therefore, an Rdata workspace with saved model objects can be loaded form here:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xo5zwykz3uj9dggj24kdg/Final_Model_Run_WKSPCE_DEC.2023.RData?rlkey=xqdkuqjkzs9yy1on9id3pt12b&dl=0

2. CAR21_ChiSquared.Rmd - this file contains the Chi-squared tests for evaluation whether deforestation occurs disproportionately in property overlaps.
   
3. CAR21_temporalANOVAS.Rmd - this file contains Analysis of Variance to test whether CAR21 property overlap is increasing over time.

Finally, it contains 3 figures which appear in the main text or supporing information appendix of the manuscript.
