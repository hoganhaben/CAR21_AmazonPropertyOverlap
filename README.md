# CAR21_AmazonPropertyOverlap
This repo is for Paul Furmo et al 2024 (in review) Land conflicts from overlapping claims in Brazilâ€™s rural environmental registry

It contains 3 Rmd files 
1. CAR21_PoissonOverlap.Rmd - this is the main analysis file which fits the Poisson generalize linear mixed-effects models.  the dataset can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/en02cup52fjp9og47uv46/CAR21_GLMMs_dataset_oct_FINAL.csv?rlkey=1sowd8uwdpykzarh6dio2yyju&dl=0.  The dataset is large and the glmm models take some time to fit.  Therefore, an Rdata workspace with save model objects can be loaded form here:  https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xo5zwykz3uj9dggj24kdg/Final_Model_Run_WKSPCE_DEC.2023.RData?rlkey=xqdkuqjkzs9yy1on9id3pt12b&dl=0

2. CAR21_ChiSquared.Rmd - this file contains the Chi Squared test for evaluation whether deforestation occurs non-randomally in regard to property overlap
   
3. CAR21_temporalANOVAS.Rmd - this file contains Analysis of Variance to test whether CAR21 property overlap is increasing over time.

It also contains 3 figures which appear in the main text or supporing information appendix of the manuscript.
